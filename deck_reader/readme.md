# Esper Reader
This is a tool written in C++ to parse basic files from Phantom Dust. It was originally planned to support
multiple formats, but code for those other formats has been moved to other projects (see the `alr_parser` folder in this repository).

## Usage
Run `EsperReader.exe`, then select a deck file from the file explorer popup.
