# Esper Reader
This is a tool written in C to parse basic files from Phantom Dust. It was
originally planned to support multiple formats, but code for those other
formats has been moved to other projects (see the `alr` folder in this
repository).

## Usage
Drag & drop any deck file onto `deck_reader.exe`, or run `deck_reader [file]`
on the command-line. Follow the instructions on the screen to close the program
(if you just want to peek at the deck contents), or enter a command to start
editing the file.
